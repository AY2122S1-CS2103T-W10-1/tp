As a student entrepreneur with a busy schedule, do you always find yourself missing an appointment/meeting with
your clients or friends? Or can't seem to find a way to easily recall details of a certain someone
who is probably stored as one of your many contacts in your Excel sheet? Fret not,
as we have designed an application called **ContactSh** just for you! It is a Desktop application for managing your contacts
as well as tasks related to each of them. It boasts a highly effective search function and contact-task tracking system.
It is also optimized for use via a Command Line Interface(CLI) that is similar in style as Linux CLIs,
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, you will be able to manage
business tasks related to your contacts more efficiently than using other traditional GUI apps.

The [Quick Start](#quick-start) section shows you how to quickly get ContactSh up and running on your computer.
If you are a new user, it is recommended to go through the instructions under [Features](#features) one by one.
If you are an experienced user, and just want to refer to the list of features, you may use the [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
to quickly navigate to the command of your choice.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter to be specified: `add -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional parameters.<br>
  e.g `-n NAME [-l LABEL]` can be specified as `-n John Doe -l friend` or `-n John Doe`.

  e.g. `[-l LABEL]…​` can be specified as `` (i.e. 0 times), `-l friend`, `-l friend -l family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command format is `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command format but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be accepted.<br>
