### Project: ContactSh

ContactSh is a new version of the AddressBook application.
The user interacts with it similarly to the AddressBook application, through the CLI.
It is built in Java and is an ongoing project.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the functionality to view the list of instructions
  * What it does: Allows the user to view all the commands that are supported
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a new user will be unfamiliar with the 
  instructions and the user would not need to view the user guide to know how to use the application. It can also
  help the existing users to remember how to use the instructions if they forget some of them.
  * Highlights: This feature will need to be updated in the future if there are any syntax changes to current instructions
  or when new instructions are implemented.
  * Credits: This idea is similar to how Windows implemented the help system on the CLI.
